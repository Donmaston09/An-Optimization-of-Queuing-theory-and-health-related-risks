# An-Optimization-of-Queuing-theory-and-health-related-risks
This study examined a queuing system at an outpatient hospital clinic post intending to minimize waiting time in association with financial cost and healthcare-related risks. We observed the queuing system using the sampling survey information of 200 outpatients that visited the clinic for 4 weeks. 
This study therefore, employs a machine learning modeling and queuing optimization models to develop a queuing modeling system to minimize outpatientsâ€™ waiting time, financial costs, and health-related risks while in the queuing system at the outpatient clinic.

Steps to Findings:

    Part 1: Data Explorations and Demographic Visualizations

    Part 2: Visualize relationships among variables of interest (Waiting time, Financial cost, Health-related risks)

    Part 3: Machine Learning technique - Classification phase;

    Inference and Interpretations

    Conclusions
